# Guess or Pass
_Developed by: Kristina Koneva (student index number: 201513)_

## Overview
Guess or Pass is a native iOS mobile application developed in [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) as the programming language of choice and [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) as a suitable modern UI framework.

It's a multiplayer game where one lucky individual takes on the role of the guesser, while others act as the clue-givers, providing hints to help the guesser identify the correct word. The objective is to guess as many words as possible from the selected category in the duration of one minute. Users can choose one of the following categories: animals, food, sports, technology, music and nature. There are several options about navigating throughout the game - users can use button clicks, swipe gestures or phone tilts to guess or pass a certain word. Additionally, users can set reminders for their game nights or similar events and they will receive a notification with the time and place.

The app supports both portrait and landscape mode (except for the game screen which is locked in landscape mode).

The app was developed for educational and learning purposes and has been inspired by the existing [Heads Up!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/heads-up/id623592465) app.

## Architecture

This app is divided into three layers: data, domain and UI layer. The state management is handled following the MVVM pattern.
### Data Layer

The data layer consists of two data sources:

- remote source (the [Datamuse API](https://www.datamuse.com/api/) source for fetching the words)
- local source ([`UserDefaults`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/userdefaults) which locally provide and store the user's name, avatar image, game navigation type and best score).

### Domain Layer

The domain layer serves as a connection between the data and the domain layer. It consists of domain models and repositories. The repositories provide an interface
for communicating with the data sources and they are used in the UI layer. They serve as an abstracted clean link to the data sources (without knowing their implementation and origin) in
the UI layer.

### UI Layer

The UI layer is simply what the user sees on the screen. Each screen consists of a `View` (literally the UI) and a `ViewModel` (which takes care of the business logic). View models do the data fetching and preparation logic and communicate all of that with the views using `@Published` properties. These properties are observed by the views, allowing them to immediately react to changes made to these properties. To ensure that these properties can only be modified by the view model, most of them are defined with private setters.

## Dependency Injection

[Swinject](https://github.com/Swinject/Swinject) is used for dependency injection. [`InjectionContainer`](https://github.com/kristinakoneva/guess-or-pass/blob/main/Guess%20or%20Pass/Guess%20or%20Pass/di/InjectionContainer.swift) provides all data sources, repositories, view models and several managers and classes which are provided as singletons, such as: [`CMMotionManager`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion/cmmotionmanager), [`CLLocationManager`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager), [`CLGeocoder`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/clgeocoder), [`NotificationManager`](https://github.com/kristinakoneva/guess-or-pass/blob/main/Guess%20or%20Pass/Guess%20or%20Pass/ui/shared/utils/NotificationManager.swift).

## Networking

The [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) HTTP networking library is used for making the API requests towards the [Datamuse API](https://www.datamuse.com/api/). 

## Screens and Features

### Welcome Screen
The first screen users see when they open the app for the first time is the welcome screen. They are required to enter their name/nickname and choose their avatar. They can pick the image for their avatar either from their photo gallery or instantly take the photo by opening their camera. Once they have provided both things and have clicked on the "Let's play ðŸ¥³" button, they will be navigated to the game screen and their choices (name and avatar) will be saved locally in the `UserDefaults`.

<br/>
<br/>

For accessing the gallery, the app doesn't need to ask for permissions because it only needs private access to the user's gallery (the app can access only the images the user selects), however, for the camera, the app has to request the permission in case the user wants to take a photo which will be their avatar.

### Home Screen
On the home screen, users can see their name, avatar and best score. The best score represents how many correct guesses they have made in one minute.

Below the user information, the available word categories are listed. Once the user has chosen their category of choice, they can proceed with playing the game by clicking the "Play" button.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
If users click on the "Play" button, but haven't chosen a category yet, an alert dialog will be shown.

<br/>
<br/>
On the top right of the screen, there is a settings icon button which navigates to the settings screen when clicked.

### Game Screen
The game screen starts with a 5 second countdown to give the users some time to prepare.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Afterwards, depending on the previously chosen category, appropriate words will be displayed on the screen. Users can navigate between the words by using the "Pass" and "Guessed" buttons, by using swipe gestures (from left to right swipe indicates a correct guess and a right to left swipe indicates that the user wants to pass the word) or by tilting the phone forwards (correct guess) or backwards (for passing the word). Users can change the navigation type in the settings. By default, all of them are enabled and if the users chooses a particular navigation type, the remaining ones will be disabled (and the "Pass" and "Guessed" buttons will be hidden if that's not the chosen type).
The 1 minute timer is displayed on the top left of this screen and on the top right there is an "End Game" button in case the user wants to finish the game prematurely before the 1 minute timer ends.

<br/>
<br/>
In the end, a dialog with the score is shown. The best score is appropriately updated and saved in case the user has beaten their previous best score.

<br/>
<br/>
#### Read instructions
An action sheet opens up where the game is explained in detail.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
#### Change game navigation
A bottom sheet opens up allowing the users to choose their preferred game navigation type.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
#### Set reminder
When this action is selected from the settings screen, a new screen for setting a reminder is shown. Users have to input the event name, date, time and place and a local notification will be scheduled 1 hour before the event date and time. When this screen is presented, the app attempts to locate the user (firstly asks for the location permission if it hasn't been requested already) and if it fails locating the user (either because the permission was not granted or because of other errors), the default value for the location is "Skopje". For the event date and time, there is validation logic so that dates in the past are not accepted and dates only 1 hour in the future and further are allowed (since the notification should arrive 1 hour before the event).
<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://github.com/kristinakoneva/guess-or-pass/assets/83497391/b9e4431e-e618-4ff7-be3e-a4a5897735e9" width=30% height=30%/>

<br/>
<br/>
Users can change the default location by clicking on the "Change location" button which will open an action sheet for selecting the coordinates of their preferred location. When they make a selection, the action sheet is dismissed and the coordinates are turned into a readable location name. Once the user is satisfied with their choices, they can click on the "Set reminder ðŸ””" button to finalize the reminder creation and a local notification will be scheduled.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
If the user is setting a reminder for a first time, they will be asked to give notification permissions so that the app can schedule notifications. If the permission request is denied, the user will be informed that they will have to enable the notifications in settings if they want to set reminders with notifications.

## Navigation
The [`Router`](https://github.com/kristinakoneva/guess-or-pass/blob/main/Guess%20or%20Pass/Guess%20or%20Pass/ui/shared/navigation/Router.swift) class is used for navigating through the different screens (views). It is inspired by the [following article](https://blorenzop.medium.com/routing-navigation-in-swiftui-f1f8ff818937) and contains several useful methods. The `Router` is provided as an environment object and it is available in each view defined in the `Guess_or_PassApp`. 

## Useful Utils
- [`CMMotionManager`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion/cmmotionmanager) - used for getting device motion updates to detect forward and backward phone tilts.
- [`OrientationInfo`](https://github.com/kristinakoneva/guess-or-pass/blob/main/Guess%20or%20Pass/Guess%20or%20Pass/ui/shared/utils/OrientationInfo.swift) - inspired by the following [thread](https://forums.developer.apple.com/forums/thread/126878) and used for obtaining device orientation information. It is primarily used for determining the device orientation when a user opens some action sheet - when the orientation sheet is landscape, a "Close" button is displayed on the action sheet because the user cannot dismiss it otherwise.
- [`NotificationManager`](https://github.com/kristinakoneva/guess-or-pass/blob/main/Guess%20or%20Pass/Guess%20or%20Pass/ui/shared/utils/NotificationManager.swift) - uses the [`UNUserNotificationCenter`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unusernotificationcenter) to check and request notification permissions and schedule local notifications.
- [`LocationPickerForSwiftUI`](https://github.com/alessiorubicini/LocationPickerForSwiftUI) - package dependency which is used on the reminder screen for selecting the event location.
- [`CLGeocoder`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/clgeocoder) - interface which is used for converting the selected geographic coordinates into a user-friendly location name when setting reminders for events.
- [`CLLocationManager`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager) - used for managing location permissions and locating the user on the reminder screen.
- [`AVCaptureDevice`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedevice) - used for managing the camera permissions when selecting/changing the avatar.
- [`UIImagePickerController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontroller) - a view controller used for opening the photo gallery or the device's camera when choosing the avatar.
